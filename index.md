# Who are the YesMen?
<img align="right" width="30%" border="10px" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V6Bv8AhcYsyl9LQz3cgkhxOGBr1CJtmEBK1rWxUSjkJGALFO98li734EtFPW312M-C_xmkJFvJb1J-NOZnUGcFkUIxkDTPwLzWAjW0EGObLEIk3usC7ittxmzZFjmjgcJBJLeeGrYEo">
- The YesMen aim to draw media attention to issues caused by corporations and government through culture jamming campaigns 
- They create fake websites, fake petitions, performances and films that look legitimate at first glance, but actually have false information that exposes/brings attention to corporate issues
- These get the public’s attention and reveal the issues and corruption in “corporate takeover” 
- The YesMen, Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos, likely have other members to help carry out their projects who need to be kept informed, and collaborate on projects
- The Yes Lab is a YesMen project, which allows other activist groups to seek help and collaboration from the YesMen to target corporations/politicians 

The YesMen utilize digital media to:

- Empower citizens by raising awareness
- Expose social class inequality
- Help other groups with campaigns

#### National Rifle Association

- The NRA responded with a sweeping DMCA notice to the webhost of the site.
- 38,000 websites, including ShareTheSafety.org were taken down in response.  
- This censorship is possible because of the monetary and political power of the NRA.

# What is Cryptomator?

## Technical Aspects

- Cryptomator functions as a virtual drive. Files are encrypted and decrypted on the fly with every file access
- 256 bit AES encryption along with a MAC masterkey is used for encryption of files and file authentication 
- WebDAV is the frontend for cryptomator and is an HTTP-based protocol. 

### Masterkey Derivation
<div style="float:right; border:10px; width:40%; font-size:75%; text-align:center;">
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lrdcmBws972rw2kDauSJWIgDiuHpiycYr7-P-J9G3csT7kkhb5K4LUXUErrSvA6ns3XCjkPz6fZm38Kg0UHDsteX77226rKtC8tPHjVKWdQDcgdeTbJU5UcbfBNyeuguAOOYcdIc8Cg" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;">
The KEK decrypts the stored masterkeys when unlocking the vault</div>

Each vault has its own encryption and MAC masterkey. A cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator called SecureRandom with ShA1PRNG is used to seed the key with 440 bits. Afterward, Scrypt encrypts the masterkey with a KEK (Key-encryption key) derived from the user’s password. Scrypt is designed to make large-scale custom hardware attacks costly by requiring large amounts of memory.

### Encryption Process

Files along with folder names are encrypted. The cleartext name of a file is encoded using UTF-8 in Normalization form C for a unique binary representation. AES-SIV is used to encrypt the file and directory names.

## What Cryptomator can do for the YesMen

<img align="right" border="15px" width="45%" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BJJN5DBGMpRYmiR4IkyB0x-zK9YyMXMZ259DZRTAaky5nwxX-P8gOvvyWGAoUio9fWgvvTG1KYU7rT9rid7qk0bC4-DsFOcyWleorukM">

The YesMen's activism is almost entirely based in digital media --video files, plans for events, hoax websites, advertisements, etc.-- all of which need to be protected and remain known to trusted collaborators only until the campaigns are released. Cryptomator allows them to secure their data on any server or cloud storage including Dropbox and Google drive. This allows for a group to share vaults and keep what they’re working on encrypted. It’s Open source and available on many platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and even as a jar.
And best of all: it is easy to use!



# Guide to Using Cryptomator

1. First, visit the [Cryptomator website](https://cryptomator.org/) and download Cryptomator for your OS. The installation process is fairly straightforward and described well on the Cryptomator website.
2. After Installation is finished, launch Cryptomator by clicking on the Cryptomator icon.
3. To create a New vault click on the + sign at the bottom right of the cryptomator window and select Create New Vault. You will be prompted to choose the location of the folder for your vault. If cloud collaboration is desired, choose either a Dropbox or Google Drive location to store your folder.

4. Enter a password for your Vault, it's a good idea to use a password manager coupled with a password generator to ensure you have a strong password.
5. To unlock and use the vault, click on your folder in Cryptomator and enter your password, Cryptomator will mount your encrypted folder as a drive. Afterwards, you can keep cryptomator running in the background and use your application of choice to access and add, edit, or remove files in the folder.

6. Once you're finished making changes and wish to lock your folder, you can go back into cryptomator and hit the lock vault button. If you forget and close cryptomator, don't fret the vault will lock automatically.
